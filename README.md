# STageCompsEstimation
This repository is to run the simulation experiment described in Correa et al. (2020) CJFAS.
The main function is 'runSimulation.R' or 'runSimulationParallel.R' (if replicates are run in parallel)

Also, the function 'CRLfunction.R' runs the CRL method for any dataset. See comments included in that file for help.
