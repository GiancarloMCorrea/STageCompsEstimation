# STageCompsEstimation
This repository runs the simulation experiment described in Correa et al. (2020) CJFAS.
The main function is 'runSimulation.R' or 'runSimulationParallel.R' (if iterations are run in parallel)

Also, the function 'CRLfunction.R' runs the CRL method for any dataset. See comments included in the file.
